## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node

- #### Node installatioOther Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```bash
$ node --version
v13.7.0

$ npm --version
6.13.6
```

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

```bash
$ npm install npm -g
```
